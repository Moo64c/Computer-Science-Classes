 This code is dangerous because when SomeFunction() exits, nNumber is deleted
 from the stack, but pPointer (which is on the heap) still points to nNumber's
 physical address, which makes the compiler leave that area of memory "locked"
 and that constitudes a memory leak - a process that if repeated enough can 
 crash a computer.
